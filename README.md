The aim of the assignment is to set up a data engineering
pipeline employing Apache Airflow and Apache Beam. This

process includes data retrieval and the creation of a zip archive.
Subsequently, another pipeline is set up for preprocessing and
visualizing monthly averages of various weather-related fields
such as Dry Bulb temperature, Dew Point temperature, etc.,
utilizing geomaps.
